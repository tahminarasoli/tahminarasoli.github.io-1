                <h2>About<br> <span>Tahmina Rasoli</span></h2>
                <p>According to my experience, the career journey for women in the field of IT is a bit more difficult than for men. After research, I learned that the reason is women are a minority in this field. As a woman in the field of technology, I decided to change this minority to equality. So, my main focus is to be able to encourage and help girls not to hesitate to choose this field.</p>
